Please see fiid.h for details concerning the fiid interface.

The following list the configurable fields of individual packet/record
templates in FreeIPMI.  Each field is listed as a list of the
following.

{ bits, "field name", field flag, field flag, ... }

bits - indicates the number of bits in the field

field name - indicates the name of the field, used for getting/setting
             fields in the fiid API.

field flags - flags indicating qualities of the field.  The following
              qualities may exist for each field.

    REQUIRED - field is required for the packet/record
    OPTIONAL - field is optional for the packet/record

    LENGTH-FIXED - field length is fixed at the number of bits listed

    LENGTH-VARIABLE - field length is variable for the number of bits
                      listed

    MAKES-PACKET-SUFFICIENT - indicates field or fields are
                              "sufficient" to make a packet/record valid
                              and not malformed, but not necessarily a
                              complete packet/record.
