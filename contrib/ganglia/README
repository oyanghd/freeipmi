ganglia_ipmi_sensors.pl
-----------------------

This script can be used to monitor IPMI sensors in ganglia via
FreeIPMI's ipmi-sensors.  Please see instructions found at the top of
the script for detailed instructions.

By default, this tool will monitor the sensor state (Nominal, Warning,
or Critical) of each sensor as determined by libfreeipmi's interpret
library and the sensor readings of temperature, fan and voltage
sensors.  See ipmi-sensors(8) for more general info on ipmi-sensors
and freeipmi_interpret_sensors.conf(5) for more information on sensor
states.
