nagios_ipmi_sensors.pl
-----------------------

This script can be used to monitor IPMI sensors in nagios via
FreeIPMI's ipmi-sensors.  Please see instructions found at the top of
the script for detailed instructions.

This tool will monitor the sensor state (Nominal, Warning, or
Critical) of each sensor as determined by libfreeipmi's interpret
library.  The Nominal, Warning, and Critical states of each sensor
will be collected and counted.  The overall IPMI sensor status will be
mapped into a Nagios status of OK, Warning, or Critical.  Details will
then be output for Nagios to read.  See ipmi-sensors(8) for more
general info on ipmi-sensors and freeipmi_interpret_sensors.conf(5)
for more information on sensor states.
