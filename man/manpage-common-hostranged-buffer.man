\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-buffer-output\fR
Buffer hostranged output.  For each node, buffer standard output until
the node has completed its IPMI operation.  When specifying this
option, data may appear to output slower to the user since the the
entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.
See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information.
