\fB\-\-entity\-sensor\-names\fR
Output sensor names prefixed with their entity id and instance number
when appropriate.  This may be necessary on some motherboards to help
identify what sensors are referencing.  For example, a motherboard may
have multiple sensors named 'TEMP'.  The entity id and instance number
may help clarify which sensor refers to "Processor 1" vs. "Processor
2".
