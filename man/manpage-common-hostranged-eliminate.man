\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-eliminate\fR
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by
.B ipmidetect.
This attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed from service in a large
cluster.  The
.B ipmidetectd
daemon must be running on the node executing the command.
