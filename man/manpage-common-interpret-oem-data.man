Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor readings, or
general extra info, etc.  If an OEM interpretation is not available,
the default output will be generated.  Correctness of OEM
interpretations cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM
vendors may make in products, firmware, etc.  See OEM INTERPRETATION
below for confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.
