No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have
been found to not support IPMI 1.5.  Those hitting this issue may see
"ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors.  This issue can
be worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
\fB\-\-driver\-type\fR=\fILAN_2_0\fR.  Issue observed on a number of
HP and Supermicro motherboards.
