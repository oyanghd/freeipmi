.TP
\fB\-\-flush\-cache\fR
Flush a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR) cache.  The
SDR is typically cached for faster subsequent access.  However, it may
need to be flushed and re-generated if the SDR has been updated on a
system.
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\-cache\fR
Do not output information about cache creation/deletion.  May be
useful in scripting.
.TP
\fB\-\-sdr\-cache\-recreate\fR
If the SDR cache is out of date or invalid, automatically recreate the
sensor data repository (SDR) cache.  This option may be useful for
scripting purposes.
