.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and
delay packet responses if duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence
numbers) are sent in succession very quickly.  There is no known way
to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC other than the wait awhile.
.PP
Unlike
.B ping(8),
local network devices (e.g. 127.0.0.1) cannot be "pinged".
